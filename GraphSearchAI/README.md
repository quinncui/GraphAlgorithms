##### 5.1 BFS


##### 5.2 State Representation

- Sometimes vertex and edge are not obvious for us, but we can define a state as a node, and from current
state to the next state can be an edge.
- We don't need to know the whole graph at the first, we can keep going from a state to another state and finally
get to the goal
